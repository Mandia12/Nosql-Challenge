Description:

In this challenge, data from a json file is imported into a new mongo database called "uk_food" in a collection named "establishments" using mongosh. From there, a .ipynb file is used with pymongo to access, update, delete, and organize the data. The exploratory analysis within the file named "NoSQL_Analysis" queries the database, at times using pipelines, to retrieve specific data used to create pandas dataframes from.
